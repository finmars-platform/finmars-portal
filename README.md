### FAQ:

- **How project is structured?**   
We are using MVC approach. Here is brief explanation.  
View - angular html template. Only stored in `./src/portal/scripts/app/views`  
Controller - javascript code that directly attached to template. Angular depended. Stored in `./src/portal/scripts/app/controllers`  
Model just a list of fields. Models do not have logic inside them. Location `./src/prtal/scripts/app/models`  
Service - javascript code that has logic related to data/events. Used in controllers.  Location `./src/prtal/scripts/app/services`  
Repository - javascript code contains XHR requests to REST API.  Location `./src/prtal/scripts/app/repositories`  
Directive - angular specific files. Basically components.  Location `./src/prtal/scripts/app/directives`  
Helper - some utility code that can be shared across multiple services.  Location `./src/prtal/scripts/app/helpers`

- **What is Core and Portal folders?**  
Our source code placed in `portal` folder. `core` contains libraries/external code
